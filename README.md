a test framework for exploring routing algorithms. the framework supports batch agent assignment, agent re-planning, and is designed for modular algorithm swapping.

the initial effort will target MATSim but the framework is designed to be extended for any simulator and any road network representation.   

### notes

- as opposed to MATSim, this system requires that unique agents take at most one trip
